# linkptr
A fascinating textbook on recovering intelligence'


### Rough util construct

1. Adjust GPU max FPS to 153 on modern AMD GPU Adrenalin software (likely RX 5XX + ). If you limit FPS to 153 on AMD GPU with a 60 hz, you can get something like hypnosis.
2. Decide with or without optical tuning device (glasses/contacts). Works better without in my experience.
3. Open linkptr/runTime.js document in an incognito Brave browser tab/window. 
4. Find a line. Select an adjacent word pair. As you think one word, focus on the other with vision.
5. Find a line directly beneath or above this one. Within, select another adjacent word pair. As you think one word, focus on the other with vision.
6. Return to first line:: focus on comma separating words chosen within this line while thinking word to think among 2nd line.
7. Repeat
8. Pair with paru https://github.com/gotdoubledots/paru

At some point after above process, attempt creation of knot below. If unsuccessful, keep at linkptr/runTime.js until possible. Then return to linkptr/runTime.js.

Also, a corollary project, with instructions as above but perhaps not requiring a FPS cap: https://github.com/gotDoubleDots/interesting
