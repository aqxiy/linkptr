# linkptr
A fascinating textbook on recovering intelligence'

## My best effort at explaining

It's like a mix between hypnosis, meditation, brain-training, and learning. To me, there are 2 solid approaches. Both require use of paramrem.com with fy.html appended to final URL. 

One of these utilizes a computer with an AMD GPU & Adrenalin software with FPS Cap 153. Also, Sublime Text. The other may be a bit less efficacious and entails use of high hz smartphone.

### Aside from directly below, most of document may be redundant as maybe better approach has been discovered/defined

### Here it goes:

% Have AMD Adrenalin installed & toggle "Frame rate target control" with setting to 153 fps. Also, on my preferred config with 4k 60hz, AMD GPU fluid rendition hack: enable GPU scaling, enable integer scaling, disable integer scaling, restart PC. All else default.

% Have Sublime Text installed (free version works fine)

% Have this Forever Young remix rendition available (simply visit page and click rectangle to play) https://gotdoubledots.github.io/paramrem_a/fy.html

1. Copy/paste linkTest.js into a Sublime Text tab, then save; or, download repo and open linkTest.js in Sublime Text. Either way, have access to the file in .js format. Also, it's good to repeatedly press enter until the cursor is below the window lower border.
2. Begin music.
3. With FPS cap @ 153, open Sublime Text maximized.

### Quick intro
Linkptr is an intriguing project hosted on GitHub by the user aqxiy. It involves a fascinating approach to recovering intelligence. Here are some key points from the projectâ€™s README:

### Adjusting GPU FPS:
The project suggests limiting the maximum frames per second (FPS) to 153 on modern AMD GPUs using Adrenalin software (likely RX 5XX+). This can reportedly induce a state akin to hypnosis. The instructions recommend deciding whether to use an optical tuning device (glasses/contacts) while experimenting with this technique.

### Word Pair Focus:
To engage in this process, open the linkptr/runTime.js document in an incognito Brave browser tab or window. Find a line and select an adjacent word pair. As you think of one word, focus on the other with your vision. Then find a line directly above or below the first one and select another adjacent word pair. Repeat the process, focusing on the chosen words. The README provides further details on this intriguing exercise.

At some point after above process, attempt creation of knot below. If unsuccessful, keep at linkptr/runTime.js until possible. Then return to linkptr/runTime.js.

Corollary Projects: The author also mentions related projects:

Historylog: A project that seems to be connected to the process described above.

Speechtherapy: Another project with similar instructions, possibly not requiring an FPS cap.



### Rough util construct - really, the intro to an alternate technique requiring Chrome & Atom 

1. Adjust GPU max FPS to 153 on modern AMD GPU Adrenalin software (likely RX 5XX + ). If you limit FPS to 153 on AMD GPU with a 60 hz, you can get something like hypnosis.
2. Decide with or without optical tuning device (glasses/contacts). Works better without in my experience.
3. Open linkptr/runTime.js document in an incognito Brave browser tab/window. 
4. Find a line. Select an adjacent word pair. As you think one word, focus on the other with vision.
5. Find a line directly beneath or above this one. Within, select another adjacent word pair. As you think one word, focus on the other with vision.
6. Return to first line:: focus on comma separating words chosen within this line while thinking word to think among 2nd line.
7. Repeat
8. Pair with historylog https://github.com/aqxiy/historylog

At some point after above process, attempt creation of knot below. If unsuccessful, keep at linkptr/runTime.js until possible. Then return to linkptr/runTime.js.

Also, a corollary project, with instructions as above but perhaps not requiring a FPS cap: https://github.com/aqxiy/speechtherapy

## Further instructions, a product of additional theory:

You want 1 Chrome Incognito window & tab within (nothing else open in Chrome); 

1 Atom window & tab within containing linkptr (left sidebar minimized w/ typing cursor offscreen); 

AMD Adrenalin -{ Gaming - > Graphics open & scrolled to "Frame rate target control".

AMD Advice: At some point on present installation, navigate to Display & { tick GPU scaling, tick Integer scaling, untick Integer scaling, restart PC }

Tip: All windows maximized, min/max with taskbar icon, taskbar left-biased, cursor moved off-screen for reading portions

& keep only 1 window open at once
